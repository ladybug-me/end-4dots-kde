The invariants the installer's step scripts have to keep: that the entrypoints exist,
that every numbered scripts/*.sh is run by one of the step lists, that the update path
sparsifies only paths src/bin/caelestia-update writes, and a few ordering guarantees
inside those scripts. They read the same few installer files and change for their own
